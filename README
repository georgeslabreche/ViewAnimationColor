Why couldnâ€™t we animate the backgroundColor property of a UIView in iOS 5.0?
See exercise #5 in http://i5.nyu.edu/~mm64/INFO1-CE9236/src/animate.html

I've recreated exercise #5 with the following environmental settings:
 - Mac OSX Version 10.7.3 (11D50)
 - Xcode Version 4.3.1 (4E1019)
 - Project's iOS Deployment Target: 5.0
 - iPhone 5.1 Simulator

Results:
Could not reproduce the issue with the deployment target explicitly set to 5.0.
Maybe it was a bug on the version of the iPhone Simulator that we were using? Maybe version 5.1 of the simulator fixed the issue?

I did read that a UILabel can't be animated, maybe we were trying with that instead?
